### **Next Steps**
1. **Setup**:
   - Configure `settings.py` for installed apps: `core`, `membership`, `payments`, `workout`.
   - Run migrations to create tables for all models.

2. **API Development**:
   - Implement REST APIs using Django REST Framework.
   - Ensure each app has proper serialization for models.
