To design meaningful, unique IDs for your `Admin`, `Equipment`, and `Maintenance` models that convey relevant information (similar to your college ID format), we can break the ID structure into components. Here's a suggestion for each model, based on your requirement of embedding meaning into the ID.

### **1. Admin ID Pattern**:
Since `Admin` typically doesn't need to reflect things like branches or admission years, we can use an ID pattern that combines:
- Year of entry or creation.
- A role identifier (if applicable).
- A sequential number or unique code.

**Suggested Pattern**: `YYYY-ROLE-XXX`
- `YYYY`: The year the admin was added to the system.
- `ROLE`: A code or abbreviation for the admin's role (e.g., "MGR" for Manager, "HR" for HR).
- `XXX`: A sequential number for admins of the same year and role.

**Example**: `2024-MGR-001`, `2024-HR-002`

### **2. Equipment ID Pattern**:
For `Equipment`, the ID could combine:
- A code for the equipment type or category.
- The year of purchase or acquisition.
- A sequential number for each piece of equipment in that category.

**Suggested Pattern**: `TYPE-YYYY-XXX`
- `TYPE`: A short code for the equipment type (e.g., "GEN" for Generator, "TREAD" for Treadmill).
- `YYYY`: The year of purchase.
- `XXX`: A sequential number for equipment of that type and year.

**Example**: `GEN-2023-001`, `TREAD-2023-002`

### **3. Maintenance ID Pattern**:
For `Maintenance`, the ID could combine:
- The equipment type code.
- The year and month of the maintenance due date.
- A sequential number for each maintenance event in that year.

**Suggested Pattern**: `EQUIPMENT-YYYYMM-XXX`
- `EQUIPMENT`: A short code for the equipment type (same as in the `Equipment` model).
- `YYYYMM`: The year and month the maintenance is due (e.g., "202312" for December 2023).
- `XXX`: A sequential number for maintenance events of the same equipment within that period.

**Example**: `GEN-202312-001`, `TREAD-202311-002`

### **Example of IDs**:

**Admin:**
- `2024-MGR-001` (Admin added in 2024 with the role of Manager, first in the system).
- `2024-HR-002` (Admin added in 2024 with the role of HR, second in the system).

**Equipment:**
- `GEN-2023-001` (First generator purchased in 2023).
- `TREAD-2023-002` (Second treadmill purchased in 2023).

**Maintenance:**
- `GEN-202312-001` (First maintenance scheduled for a generator in December 2023).
- `TREAD-202311-002` (Second maintenance scheduled for a treadmill in November 2023).
